### Hi there 👋

Software engineer who is detail-oriented and motivated with passion for building high-quality, clean and efficient code.  Always striving for growth, I expanded my coding acumen through a 1,000+ hour coding Bootcamp focused on Node and React, where I mastered working independently in a collaborative setting by pushing all features to production ahead of C level deadlines.  I have gained experience with front-end technology that incorporates backend and full stack technologies, most evidently bringing about a new platform for 40,000 users. Through leadership and expertise, I am now giving back by being a teaching assistant for another web development bootcamp. I am now eager to tackle more complex challenges and continue to find ways to build front end and Node JS solutions for real-world problems.
